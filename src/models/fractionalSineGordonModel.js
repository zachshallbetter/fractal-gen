/**
 * @module models/fractionalSineGordonModel
 * @description Implements the Fractional Sine-Gordon Equation using advanced numerical methods.
 * Supports methods like He-Laplace and LADM for solving fractional partial differential equations.
 *
 * This module achieves its intent by:
 * - Defining the fractional sine-Gordon equation with appropriate fractional derivatives
 * - Implementing solvers for numerical approximation of the equation
 * - Allowing customization of parameters such as `alpha`, `beta`, and `maxTerms`
 * - Integrating with the fractal generation pipeline for visualization
 *
 * @since 1.0.1
