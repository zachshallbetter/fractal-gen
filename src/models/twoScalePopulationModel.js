/**
 * @module models/twoScalePopulationModel
 * @description Implements the Two-Scale Population Model using fractional calculus methods.
 * Utilizes methods like LADM and Runge-Kutta Solver for modeling population dynamics.
 *
 * This module achieves its intent by:
 * - Defining the two-scale population equations incorporating fractional orders
 * - Implementing numerical solvers suitable for stiff equations and complex dynamics
 * - Allowing flexibility in parameter selection to model different scenarios
 * - Providing data outputs compatible with visualization modules
 *
 * @since 1.0.1
