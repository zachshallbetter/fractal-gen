/**
 * @module models/fractionalSchrodingerModel
 * @description Implements the Fractional Schrödinger Equation using numerical methods suitable for quantum systems with fractional dynamics.
 * Utilizes methods like the Runge-Kutta Solver and Fractional Complex Transform.
 *
 * This module achieves its intent by:
 * - Defining the fractional Schrödinger equation with appropriate fractional derivatives
 * - Implementing numerical solvers capable of handling complex-valued functions
 * - Supporting parameters like `alpha`, `beta`, `timeSteps`, and `timeEnd`
 * - Providing accurate simulation data for visualization
 *
 * @since 1.0.1
