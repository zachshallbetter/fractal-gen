/**
 * @module models/fractionalHeatEquationModel
 * @description Implements the Fractional Heat Equation using numerical methods like Bernstein Polynomials and Operational Matrices.
 * Models heat transfer phenomena with fractional time and space derivatives.
 *
 * This module achieves its intent by:
 * - Defining the fractional heat equation incorporating fractal-fractional derivatives
 * - Implementing Bernstein Polynomials and Operational Matrices methods
 * - Allowing parameterization of fractional orders and polynomial degrees
 * - Providing output data suitable for generating high-quality visualizations
